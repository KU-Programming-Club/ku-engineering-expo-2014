                <abstract>Every day, countless automobiles can be seen driving on the streets. What
                    goes into the design of one of these? Each year, Jayhawk Motorsports starts from scratch to design and build Formula SAE and Electric race cars.</abstract>
                <description>The goal of this is for K-12 students to explore the design process to create a gravity-powered race car that is the fastest as well as the lightest. The time it takes for the car to make it down the ramp, over the two bumps, and across the finish line will be recorded.</description>

                <abstract>A pulley weight lifting. Teams of up to 3 people.</abstract>
                <description>Participants are given a standard set of pulleys and a given length of rope/string. The goal is for the teams to build a pulley configuration that reduces the amount of force to lift a weight, using the least amount of pulleys. Teams can try up to 3 configurations of pulleys to lift a standard mass. Scores will be the force required to lift the mass (small scores are better).</description>

                <description>Students will be asked to design drilling mud in order to learn about the different properties of mud utilized in drilling a well. Students will be racing their mud samples down slides made from PVC pipes on an incline. Students will try to design a drilling mud that has a low viscosity so it can flow quicker down the incline. The practical application of a low viscosity is that it makes the mud easier to pump and circulate through the well.</description>

                <abstract>Take a visit to the Olympic Village with AES and AIChe! In this room you will be able to witness a wide array of dizzying demonstrations!</abstract>
                <description>The first demonstration is the Carbonator. Here students will able to make their own soda by using a CO2 tank, water and various syrups. Next is the Ferrofluid, here students will be able to interact with the Ferrofluid using various magnets to learn how magnetic fields influence the properties of the fluid. Third is the surface tension experiment where students can use milk, dye and soap to break the surface tension of the milk and create colorful patterns all across the liquid. Fourth is the chocolate melting points where students will discover the heat capacity of certain chocolates using their taste buds! Next is the phase change experiment where students will see first hand how a phase change can affect the volume of a soda can by making it implode! After that we will have the energy bike where students will be able to ride the bike and power light bulbs. After that is the Hydrophobic sand. This experiment demonstrates how our special hydrophobic sand is resistant to water. When poured into a mixture of water and oil, it will grab the oil but resist the water, creating a sand oil mixture at the bottom of the bowl. Next is the viscosity columns where students will be able to pump air through 3 tall column filled with a certain liquids to demonstrate viscosity. Last is the fluidized bed which is a sand bed with air flowing through it. The fine sand at the top will begin to bubble like water. Its cool. The competitions we will have are the volcano distance competition and the ChemE car. In the volcano competition students will bring their pre-built volcanoes and we will provide them with vinegar and baking soda and measure how far their volcano erupts. In the ChemE car competition students will bring their ChemE cars and see how fast and far they can go!</description>

                <abstract>The goal of this race is for K-12 students to explore the role batteries and electric motors play in the future of automobiles.</abstract>
                <description>The competition is a battery-powered race involving a student-constructed car. The participants will start on one end of a flat platform that is approximately 10 feet long. The car can have the maximum dimensions of 7” wide by 15.5” long and 4.5” high (average size of a shoebox). The students will compete one at time. The time it takes for the car to traverse the platform and across the finish line (indicated by tape) will be recorded. Students will get two time-recorded attempts.</description>

                <description>The egg drop contest is sponsored by Sigma Gamma Tau and is a test of creativity and understanding of physics.  Students are tasked with creating a structure that will safely house an egg during a 17 foot free fall.  The winning crate will be decided upon based on a combination of creativity, time in the air, and of course, the safety of the egg. Competitors are encouraged to think outside the box, and may the best egg drop win!</description>

                <description>From the impressive renovations and installations for the last world games in London 2012, to the Bird's Nest and Water Cube for the Olympics in China you will be able to relive these structures in AEI's and ASHRAE's Historic Building room! In addition, you will also get to try your hand at designing your very own Skyscraper and get it tested to see how much stress it can uphold in the Skyscraper competition. In this room, you will also be able to visit EERI's display as well as Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity's interactive biking activity!</description>

                <description>Participants are given a standard set of pulleys and a given length of rope/string. The goal is for the teams to build a pulley configuration that reduces the amount of force to lift a weight, using the least amount of pulleys. Teams can try up to 3 configurations of pulleys to lift a standard mass. Scores will be the force required to lift the mass (small scores are better).</description>

                <description>Students will be asked to design drilling mud in order to learn about the different properties of mud utilized in drilling a well. Students will be racing their mud samples down slides made from PVC pipes on an incline. Students will try to design a drilling mud that has a low viscosity so it can flow quicker down the incline. The practical application of a low viscosity is that it makes the mud easier to pump and circulate through the well.</description>

                <abstract>Take a visit to the Olympic Village with AES and AIChe! In this room you will be able to witness a wide array of dizzying demonstrations!</abstract>
                <description>The first demonstration is the Carbonator. Here students will able to make their own soda by using a CO2 tank, water and various syrups. Next is the Ferrofluid, here students will be able to interact with the Ferrofluid using various magnets to learn how magnetic fields influence the properties of the fluid. Third is the surface tension experiment where students can use milk, dye and soap to break the surface tension of the milk and create colorful patterns all across the liquid. Fourth is the chocolate melting points where students will discover the heat capacity of certain chocolates using their taste buds! Next is the phase change experiment where students will see first hand how a phase change can affect the volume of a soda can by making it implode! After that we will have the energy bike where students will be able to ride the bike and power light bulbs. After that is the Hydrophobic sand. This experiment demonstrates how our special hydrophobic sand is resistant to water. When poured into a mixture of water and oil, it will grab the oil but resist the water, creating a sand oil mixture at the bottom of the bowl. Next is the viscosity columns where students will be able to pump air through 3 tall column filled with a certain liquids to demonstrate viscosity. Last is the fluidized bed which is a sand bed with air flowing through it. The fine sand at the top will begin to bubble like water. Its cool. The competitions we will have are the volcano distance competition and the ChemE car. In the volcano competition students will bring their pre-built volcanoes and we will provide them with vinegar and baking soda and measure how far their volcano erupts. In the ChemE car competition students will bring their ChemE cars and see how fast and far they can go!</description>

                <description>The competition is a battery-powered race involving a student-constructed car. The participants will start on one end of a flat platform that is approximately 10 feet long. The car can have the maximum dimensions of 7” wide by 15.5” long and 4.5” high (average size of a shoebox). The students will compete one at time. The time it takes for the car to traverse the platform and across the finish line (indicated by tape) will be recorded. Students will get two time-recorded attempts.</description>

                <description>The first demonstration is the Carbonator. Here students will able to make their own soda by using a CO2 tank, water and various syrups. Next is the Ferrofluid, here students will be able to interact with the Ferrofluid using various magnets to learn how magnetic fields influence the properties of the fluid. Third is the surface tension experiment where students can use milk, dye and soap to break the surface tension of the milk and create colorful patterns all across the liquid. Fourth is the chocolate melting points where students will discover the heat capacity of certain chocolates using their taste buds! Next is the phase change experiment where students will see first hand how a phase change can affect the volume of a soda can by making it implode! After that we will have the energy bike where students will be able to ride the bike and power light bulbs. After that is the Hydrophobic sand. This experiment demonstrates how our special hydrophobic sand is resistant to water. When poured into a mixture of water and oil, it will grab the oil but resist the water, creating a sand oil mixture at the bottom of the bowl. Next is the viscosity columns where students will be able to pump air through 3 tall column filled with a certain liquids to demonstrate viscosity. Last is the fluidized bed which is a sand bed with air flowing through it. The fine sand at the top will begin to bubble like water. Its cool. The competitions we will have are the volcano distance competition and the ChemE car. In the volcano competition students will bring their pre-built volcanoes and we will provide them with vinegar and baking soda and measure how far their volcano erupts. In the ChemE car competition students will bring their ChemE cars and see how fast and far they can go!</description>
